### Examples of Project

### Background
For this project, we were given a set of class requirements and data files to use. We were required to come up with our own MVP and design decisions for our app. During the planning stages, we came up with an outline of iterations to have an idea of what we wanted to complete and when. We also created a wireframe of what we wanted our application to look like on the browser. A lot of decisions on the look of the project was decided while designing the site. In addition, we tend to enjoy Javascript more than CSS, so our focus was more on functionality than design.

### Reflection
Taryn - I really enjoyed working on this project! It was definitely a challenge, but one I greatly enjoyed. I felt like I learned a lot, especially about accessing arrays and objects, and iterating over both. I also gained a lot more experience with DOM manipulation, which I really enjoyed. I am also really proud of figuring out how to get the filter and search functions to work. I do think that I need to work on improving my CSS and DOM manipulation because I had so much trouble inserting the data into the HTML to display on the page.
